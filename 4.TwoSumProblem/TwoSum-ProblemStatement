Problem Statement: Given an array of integers nums[] and an integer target, 
    return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target.

Note: Assume that there is exactly one solution, and
    you are not allowed to use the same element twice.
Example: If target is equal to 6 and num[1] = 3, then nums[1] + nums[1] = target is not a solution.

Rough Work

Input : int[] InputArray, int target
Output : int[] indices #Indices of items that sum to target

Assumption :- Exactly One Solution #Return the first answer(indice value) that matches the sum of target 

To Note :- Do Not repeat The same index

Solution 1 :
